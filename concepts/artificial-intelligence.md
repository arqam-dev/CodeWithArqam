## Overview of Artificial Intelligence

### What is AI?

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a broad field with no single agreed-upon definition. The challenge isn't the words—we know what "artificial" and "intelligence" mean—but that the goalposts keep moving as technology advances.

### The Definition Problem

- **No Simple Definition:** No universal definition that always distinguishes AI from non-AI
- **Moving Goalposts:** As soon as a goal is achieved, it's no longer considered "real intelligence"
- **Historical Context:** Field of study since the 1950s, but definition remains elusive
- **Changing Goals:** New aspirations and problems constantly emerge

### The AI Effect

- **Phenomenon:** Technology that begins as AI research stops being called AI once it becomes practical
- **Examples:** Facial recognition, voice assistants, autocomplete
- **Reality:** Many everyday technologies started as AI research
- **Impact:** Makes defining AI even more challenging

### Why It Matters

- **Recent Impact:** ChatGPT reached 100 million users in 2 months (2022)
- **Widespread Interest:** Unprecedented enthusiasm mixed with apprehension
- **Personal Relevance:** Affects individuals directly, not just companies or projects
- **Future Impact:** Will continue to affect work and life more and more

**Process:**
1. **Gather Data:** Collect examples (thousands, millions)
2. **Clean and Prepare:** Remove irrelevant data, ensure quality
3. **Train Model:** Feed data into ML algorithm
4. **Test:** Use trained model on new data

**Example:** Recognizing handwritten number 3
- Conventional: Try to code all possible ways to write 3
- ML: Provide thousands of images of handwritten 3s, let system learn patterns

### Common Applications

**Classification:**
- Categorize or classify data
- Examples: Spam detection, medical diagnosis, fraud detection, sentiment analysis
- Question: "What is this?"

**Regression:**
- Predict numerical values
- Examples: House prices, crop yields, hospital stay length
- Based on: Multiple factors affecting the value

**Other Applications:**
- Clustering
- Anomaly detection

### Requirements

- **Lots of Data:** Need substantial amounts of training data
- **Good Quality Data:** Clean, relevant, properly labeled
- **Data Preparation:** Most important part of ML process

<expand title="How Generative AI Works and Limitations">
## How Generative AI Works and Limitations

### How It Works

**Analogy: Advanced Autocomplete**
- Predicts statistically most likely next word, phrase, or paragraph
- Based on patterns learned from training data
- Doesn't actually understand—makes statistical predictions

**Example:**
- "It's going to be a beautiful..." → suggests "day" or "night"
- Most likely option, but can still be wrong
- Could be "wedding," "cake," "house," etc.

### The Understanding Problem

**What AI Does:**
- Matches patterns from training data
- Makes new combinations
- Generates convincing, believable results

**What AI Doesn't Do:**
- Doesn't have fundamental knowledge of the world
- Doesn't understand consequences
- Doesn't understand true and false
- Doesn't actually understand anything

### Limitations Example

**Image Generation:**
- Prompt: "Photo of boy looking at egg he just dropped on concrete floor"
- **Result:** Looks good visually
- **Problem:** Egg should be broken (it's on concrete)
- **Why:** AI doesn't understand physics or consequences

### Hallucinations

- **Definition:** AI makes up answers that sound right but aren't true
- **Characteristics:** Incredibly convincing, sometimes 95-98% correct
- **Example:** ChatGPT describing non-existent "Dream view XR 2023 headset" with specific fake specs
- **Reality:** Very close to being right, but factually incorrect

### Important Considerations

- **Fact Check:** Always verify information from generative AI
- **Technical References:** Be especially careful with technical explanations
- **Not Perfect:** Amazing results don't mean correct results
- **Human Judgment:** Still need human oversight and verification

- Model learned: "Successful candidate = male"
- **Result:** Reinforced gender inequality unintentionally

**Problem:**
- No intentional human prejudice
- Model reflects patterns in training data
- Can amplify existing biases in society

### The Black Box Problem

**Issue:**
- ML models provide answers, not explanations
- "Why did Candidate A score 5/5 and Candidate B score 2/5?" → No answer
- Algorithm designed for results, not explanations

**Consequences:**
- Difficult to detect bias
- Can reinforce biases without realizing it
- Hard to understand decision-making process

### Explainable AI

- **Definition:** AI techniques that provide human-readable explanations
- **Purpose:** Address black box problem
- **Regulations:** EU GDPR includes "right to explanation"
- **Use Cases:** Credit decisions, job applications must provide explanations

### Deepfakes

- **Definition:** AI-generated deceptive content (video, image, audio)
- **Purpose:** Make it seem like someone said/did something they didn't
- **Technology:** Uses deep neural networks
- **Reality:** Extremely realistic, already being used
- **Concern:** Misinformation and deception

### Responsible AI

**Initiatives:**
