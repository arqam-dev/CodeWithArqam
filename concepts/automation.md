<expand title="Automation and Jobs">
## Automation and Jobs

- **Impact on Employment**: 
  - Affects existing jobs (that's the point)
  - Causes some occupations to disappear
  - Creates new occupations
  - Makes some jobs less valuable, others more valuable
  - Not just about destroying jobs - also creates opportunities

- **Historical Context**: 
  - Automation in workplace began with textile industry (late 1500s)
  - Stocking frame machines replaced knitters and sewers
  - Always been conflict between automation and people whose jobs were affected
  - Led to machine breakers, riots, new laws

- **Modern Differences**:
  - Most jobs aren't single-task like knitting fabric
  - Knowledge workers do many varied tasks
  - Hard to envision software replacing entire job
  - **Better question**: Is there any small part of my job that could be automated?

- **Focus**: Automate one specific task, not the entire job
  - Small, repetitive, predictable pieces of work
  - Streamline and smooth out processes
  - Free people for higher-value work

- **Benefits Beyond Cost**:
  - Improve speed
  - Improve customer service
  - Remove boredom and tedium
  - Reduce errors
  - Improve quality and consistency
  - Better governance and data collection

  - **Repeating Appointments**: Calendar apps with recurring events
    - Saves from creating same appointment 26 times
    - Reduces errors (wrong time, skipped weeks, typos)
    - Common requirement, already built into most calendar apps

- **Three Qualities of Automation**:
  1. **Often Simple**: Tasks aren't difficult, just repetitive and tedious
  2. **Requires Choices**: Need to provide rules and parameters (weekly, monthly, how many times)
  3. **Cumulative Benefits**: Small savings add up over time

- **Desktop Automation Tools**:
  - **Mac**: Automator (pre-installed)
  - **Windows**: Task Scheduler, Power Automate (free download)
  - **iPhone**: Shortcuts app

  - Going home shortcut: Get directions, send ETA text, set status, start audiobook
  - Expense report filing: Multiple steps automated with one action

- **When Automation Triggers**:
  - **On Request**: Manually press button to initiate
  - **Scheduled**: Specific date and time
  - **Event-Triggered**: When leaving office, arriving home, etc.

- **Web-Based Automation**: 
  - Tools like IFTTT.com or Zapier.com
  - Connect multiple web applications (Gmail, Dropbox, Trello, Slack)
  - Example: Email with attachment → Rename → Copy to Dropbox → Create Trello card → Set reminder
  - Need configuration for authentication to different tools

<expand title="Robotic Process Automation (RPA)">
## Robotic Process Automation (RPA)

- **What RPA Is**:
  - Business-focused software automation
  - Not physical robots (like in car factories)
  - Small independent software pieces that replicate human tasks
  - Applies to typical office environment

- **Why "Robotic"**: 
  - Not building new applications with user interfaces
  - Creating software that replicates what a person would do
  - Mimics human behavior with computer applications

- **Good Candidates for RPA**:
  - **Predictable**: Same steps every time
  - **Repeatable**: Happens frequently
  - **Computer-Based**: Interactions between person and applications
  - **Rule-Driven**: Can describe exactly how it should work
  - **Swivel Chair Work**: Moving between multiple applications

- **Example Scenario**:
  - Wait for order in old mainframe system
  - Copy data to web-based internal system
  - Send email to warehouse
  - Log into inventory database and update stock
  - Create calendar reminder
  - Multiple applications that don't talk to each other

- **RPA Benefits**:
  - **Faster**: Completes tasks more quickly
  - **24/7 Availability**: Runs continuously
  - **More Accurate**: Reduces human errors
  - **Monitorable**: Behavior can be logged and analyzed
  - **Cost-Effective**: Less expensive than custom software development
  - **Non-Intrusive**: Works with existing systems without changing them

- **Employee Considerations**:
  - If employees feel automation removes tedious busywork → positive
  - If employees feel automation is replacing their job → negative
  - Important to communicate purpose and benefits

<expand title="Automation Strategy">
## Automation Strategy

- **Common Issue**: 
  - Automation often implemented on teams/projects first
  - Before organizational strategy exists
  - Results in "islands of automation"
  - Different approaches and tools across organization

- **Solution: Central Team or Initiative**:
  - Automation best practices team
  - Center of excellence
  - Can be dedicated team or informal collection of individuals
  - Share knowledge, best practices, implementation guidance
  - Help communicate to affected people

- **Key Strategy Areas**:

  1. **Process Identification**:
     - How to identify processes to automate?
     - Is existing process as good as it could be?
     - **Garbage in, garbage out**: Automating bad process = faster bad process
     - May need to improve process before automating

  2. **People Involvement**:
     - How to involve current process owners?
     - What are impacts on them?
     - Is it worth doing?

  3. **Business Case**:
     - Describe in plain language: Why will automation help?
     - Cost savings vs. pain point reduction
     - Reduce errors vs. improve response time
     - What to do with freed-up resources?

  4. **Implementation**:
     - What people, vendors, tools?
     - Data storage policies
     - Governance and information management
     - IT involvement
     - Proof of concept or pilot?

  5. **Staff Management**:
     - Retrain on new process?
     - Free up for new things?
     - Upskill into something new?

  6. **Metrics**:
     - What to measure?
     - **Paradox of Automation**: As system becomes more efficient, less human involvement, but that involvement becomes more critical
     - Example: Customer support automation may make average response times worse (only difficult cases reach humans)
     - Need to measure right things

  7. **Exception Handling**:
     - How to elevate situations that need person?
     - Critical for success

- **Strategic Approach**:
  - Don't always require huge projects and major initiatives
  - Part of everyday approach
  - More people feeling empowered to use these technologies
  - Still needs technical support, education, attitude shift
  - Continuous rollout of AI/ML features into automation
  - Valuable business skill for any role
