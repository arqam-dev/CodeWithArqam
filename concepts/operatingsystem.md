# Operating System

## Primary Concepts

<expand title="Notes">
## Notes

- Operating System (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware and software resources
- Provides common services for computer programs
- Acts as an intermediary between programs and computer hardware

</expand>

<expand title="Kernel">
## Kernel

- Core of every operating system
- Manages all communications between software and hardware components
- Controls CPU scheduling, memory management, device management, file management

</expand>

<expand title="Virtual Memory">
## Virtual Memory

- Memory management technique that allows processes to execute outside of physical memory
- Uses demand paging to bring pages from disk to RAM as needed
- Allows running programs larger than available RAM

</expand>

<expand title="Virtual Memory Working">
## Virtual Memory Working

- OS looks at RAM for areas not used recently and copies them onto hard disk (swapping)
- Frees up space in RAM to load new applications
- When needed, swapped pages are brought back from disk to RAM
- Allows efficient memory utilization and multitasking

</expand>

<expand title="Demand Paging">
## Demand Paging

- When not all of a process's pages are in RAM, OS brings missing required pages from disk into RAM
- Pages are loaded on-demand rather than all at once
- Reduces memory usage and allows running more processes

</expand>

<expand title="Thread">
## Thread

- Basic unit of CPU utilization
- Thread consists of: thread ID, program counter, register set, and stack
- Multiple threads can exist within same process, sharing memory space
- Threads are lighter weight than processes (less overhead)

</expand>

<expand title="Multitasking VS Multithreading">
## Multitasking VS Multithreading

- Multitasking: Allows CPU to perform multiple tasks (programs, processes, tasks) simultaneously
- Multithreading: Allows multiple threads of the same process to execute simultaneously
- Multitasking: Process-level parallelism
- Multithreading: Thread-level parallelism within a single process

</expand>

<expand title="Preemptive Multitasking">
## Preemptive Multitasking

- Allows operating system to switch between software programs
- OS can interrupt a running process and switch to another
- Ensures fair CPU time allocation among processes
- Prevents a single process from monopolizing CPU

</expand>

<expand title="Time Sharing System">
## Time Sharing System

- Form of multitasking
- Multiple users can access system resources simultaneously
- CPU time is divided and allocated to different processes/users

</expand>

<expand title="Deadlock">
## Deadlock

- Deadlock is a situation where two or more processes are blocked forever
- Necessary conditions for deadlock (all must occur simultaneously):
  - Mutual Exclusion: At least one resource must be held in non-shareable mode
  - Hold and Wait: Process holding at least one resource is waiting for additional resources
  - No Preemption: Resources cannot be preempted
  - Circular Wait: Circular chain of processes waiting for resources held by other processes
- Prevention: Break one or more necessary conditions
- Avoidance: Banker's Algorithm - ensures system never enters unsafe state

</expand>

<expand title="Banker's Algorithm">
## Banker's Algorithm

- Deadlock-avoidance algorithm in a system
- Named after banking system where bank never allocates available cash in a way that prevents satisfying all customers
- Checks if granting a resource request leads to safe state before allocating
- Ensures system can always satisfy all resource requests

</expand>

<expand title="Logical Address VS Physical Address">
## Logical Address VS Physical Address

- Logical Address (Virtual Address):
  - Address generated by CPU
  - Added with base address to form physical address
  - Virtual addresses used by processes
- Physical Address:
  - Actual address seen by memory unit
  - Logical Address + Base Address = Physical Address
  - Hardware address where data is actually stored

</expand>

<expand title="CPU Registers Types">
## CPU Registers Types

- Accumulators: Store intermediate arithmetic and logic results
- Index Registers: Store index values for addressing modes
- Stack Pointer: Points to top of stack in memory
- General Purpose Registers: Can store data or addresses
- Program Counter: Contains address of next instruction to execute

</expand>

<expand title="I/O Status Information">
## I/O Status Information

- Purpose: I/O devices are to be allocated for a particular process
- Tracks which I/O devices are assigned to which processes
- Manages device allocation and status

</expand>

<expand title="Spooling">
## Spooling

- Normally associated with printing
- When different applications want to send output to printer simultaneously
- Spooling takes all print jobs into a disk file and queues them accordingly to printer
- Allows non-blocking I/O operations
- Example: Print spooler manages print queue

</expand>

<expand title="Caching">
## Caching

- Process of utilizing a region of fast memory for limited data and processes
- Stores frequently accessed data in faster memory
- Reduces access time and improves performance
- Types: CPU cache, disk cache, web cache

</expand>

<expand title="Interrupts">
## Interrupts

- Part of hardware mechanism that sends notification to CPU when resource access is needed
- Hardware interrupt: Generated by hardware devices (keyboard, mouse, timer)
- Software interrupt: Generated by programs (system calls)
- Allows CPU to handle asynchronous events efficiently

</expand>

<expand title="Assembler">
## Assembler

- Translator for low-level assembly language
- Converts assembly code to machine code
- One-to-one mapping between assembly instructions and machine code

</expand>

<expand title="Piping/Plumbing">
## Piping/Plumbing

- Process of using output of one program as input to another program
- Connects standard output of one command to standard input of another
- Example: command1 | command2 (pipe operator in Unix/Linux)

</expand>

<expand title="Internal Commands VS External Commands">
## Internal Commands VS External Commands

- Internal Commands: Built-in commands that are part of operating system shell
  - Executed directly by shell, no separate process needed
  - Examples: cd, echo, exit (in command line)
- External Commands: Separate file programs stored in separate folder/directory
  - Requires separate process to execute
  - Examples: ls, grep, cat (in Unix/Linux)

</expand>

<expand title="File System (Ubuntu/Linux)">
## File System (Ubuntu/Linux)

- In Ubuntu/Linux: Everything in hardware is a FILE
- No separate concept of "folders" - directories are special types of files
- Unix philosophy: "Everything is a file" (devices, directories, regular files)
- VFS (Virtual File System): Provides uniform interface for different file system types

</expand>

## Secondary Concepts

<expand title="Security (Why Ubuntu/Linux is Safer)">
## Security (Why Ubuntu/Linux is Safer)

- Ubuntu uses Linux, which is a secure OS system
- Does not support malicious emails and contents easily
- User permission system: Root vs regular users
- Package management system: Centralized, signed packages reduce malware risk
- Open source: Vulnerabilities are discovered and patched quickly

</expand>

<expand title="Malware Types">
## Malware Types

- Virus: Self-replicating code that attaches to files/programs
- Trojans: Malicious software disguised as legitimate software
- Spyware: Software that collects user information without consent
- Worms: Self-replicating malware that spreads over networks
- Adware: Software that displays unwanted advertisements

</expand>

<expand title="Abbreviations">
## Abbreviations

- FCFS: First-Come, First-Served (scheduling algorithm)
- SMP: Symmetric Multi-Processing (multiple processors)
- VFS: Virtual File System (abstract layer for file systems)
- GUI: Graphical User Interface
- NOS: Network Operating System
- OS: Operating System
- CPU: Central Processing Unit
- RAM: Random Access Memory
- I/O: Input/Output

</expand>

<expand title="Throughput">
## Throughput

- Number of processes completed per unit time
- Measure of system performance
- Higher throughput means more processes completed in given time

</expand>
