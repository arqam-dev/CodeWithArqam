# PMP

## Primary Concepts

<expand title="General Points">
## General Points

- Sprint should be of min 3 weeks. Standard by Google, Microsoft, etc.
- Software Artifacts: Packages, etc.
- Testable code = With Unit Testing.

</expand>

<expand title="Jira">
## Jira

- Jira Query Language (JQL): Used for advanced searching and filtering in Jira
- Issue Types:
  - Build Delivery
  - Bug, Client Reported Bug
  - New Feature, Story
  - Change Request
  - QA Suggestion, QA Estimation's, Testing Report
  - Epic
  - Question
  - Impediments
  - Complaints
  - Leaves (s)
  - Management Task, Support Tasks
  - Improvement

<expand title="Terminology">
## Terminology

- Sprint: Short, time-boxed period when scrum team works to complete a set amount of work
- Story: User requirement or feature from user perspective
- Task: Smaller work items that break down stories
- Backlog: List of work items prioritized by product owner

</expand>

<expand title="Agile">
## Agile

- Umbrella term, not a methodology itself
- Set of principles emphasizing flexibility, collaboration, and customer value
- Breaks down big, complex projects into bite-sized pieces
- 
- Frameworks:
  - Scrum:
  - Product Owner: Responsible for overall success of the product, manages product backlog
  - Development Team: Dev + test team members who do the work
  - Scrum Master: Facilitates Scrum process, removes blockers, ensures Scrum framework is followed
  - Sprint Planning: Team plans work for upcoming sprint
  - Sprint Backlogs: Work items broken down into tasks for the sprint
  - Sprint: 1 week to 1 month (typically 2-4 weeks)
  - Daily Scrum/Standup: Average 15 min, conducted by Scrum Master
    - Questions: What did I work on yesterday? What am I working on today? What issues are blocking me?
  - Sprint Review: Meeting with product owner to demonstrate completed work
  - Sprint Retrospective: Meeting for good practices, improvements for next sprint
  - Artifacts: Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, Increment
  - Scrum of Scrums: Coordination mechanism for multiple Scrum teams
  - Distributed Scrum: Scrum teams working across different locations
  - Optimize sprints with automation:
    - Send weekly Slack message with all issues still open in sprint
    - When sprint finishes, assign outstanding issues to next sprint
    - When issue moves to 'In Progress' and sprint is empty, move issue to next active sprint
  - Best Practices:
    - Don't create too many stories
    - Stories vs Tasks: Stories are user requirements, tasks are implementation details
  - Extreme Programming (XP):
  - Emphasizes technical practices, teamwork, etc.
  - Customer works very close to the dev team
  - Values (total 12): Simplicity, Communication, Feedback (deliveries, commitment, etc), Respect, Courage
  - Kanban:
  - Visual workflow management system
  - Uses boards with columns (To Do, In Progress, Done)
  - Continuous flow of work items
  - Work-in-progress (WIP) limits to prevent bottlenecks
  - Scrumban:
  - Hybrid approach combining Scrum and Kanban
  - Uses Scrum ceremonies with Kanban's continuous flow
  - Lean:
  - Also known as "Just-in-time" production.
  - Principals:
    - Eliminating Waste
    - Amplifying learning
    - Deciding as late as possible
    - Delivering as fast as possile
    - Empowering the team
    - Building integrity in
    - Seeing the whole
  - Crystal
  - DSDM
  - FDD

<expand title="Shift Left Stategy">
## Shift Left Stategy

- The "shifting left" strategy in software development refers to the practice of moving certain activities and processes earlier in the software development lifecycle.
- Shifting left involves various practices and techniques, including:
  - Early Testing
  - Continuous Integration (CI)
  - Static Code Analysis
  - Code Reviews
  - Security Testing
  - Requirements Validation
  - Documentation
  - Collaboration and Communication
  - Automation
