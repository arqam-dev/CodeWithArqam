# Sustainability and Technology

## Primary Concepts

<expand title="Introduction to Sustainability in Technology">
## Introduction to Sustainability in Technology

- **Business Focus**: Sustainability in business, particularly how technology helps sustainability efforts
- **Technology's Role**: How AI, cloud computing, and data science support sustainability
- **Beyond Cliches**: Moving past common environmental imagery to practical business applications
- **Multiple Areas**: Sustainability applies to agriculture, transportation, tourism, and business

- **Key Drivers**:
  - Regulations and global movements
  - Employee expectations from within organizations
  - Customer and investor demands from outside
  - Practical benefits: cost reduction, efficiency, new business models

- **Corporate Reports**: Most large organizations now publish sustainability reports alongside financial reports
  - Shows how businesses measure and track progress
  - Reveals main sustainability goals and priorities

<expand title="Carbon Terminology">
## Carbon Terminology

- **Carbon in Context**: Refers to carbon dioxide (CO₂), not solid carbon
  - Colorless, odorless greenhouse gas
  - Generated from natural processes (breathing) and human activities (driving, electricity from coal)

- **Measurement**: CO₂ emissions measured in metric tons
  - One metric ton of CO₂ ≈ driving 2,500 miles in average gasoline car
  - Global emissions: 33-36 billion metric tons per year (36 gigatons)

- **Why Focus on CO₂**: 
  - Most significant greenhouse gas
  - Persists in atmosphere for centuries
  - Measurable increase over time
  - Other gases measured as CO₂ equivalent (CO₂e)

- **Main Sources of CO₂**:
  1. **Power Generation**: Coal and gas power stations
  2. **Transportation**: Planes, trains, cars, trucks, boats
  3. **Industrial Production**: Manufacturing processes

<expand title="Carbon Goals and Terms">
## Carbon Goals and Terms

- **Carbon Neutral**: 
  - Estimated carbon footprint is balanced by funding offset activities
  - Buys carbon offsets (renewable energy projects, reforestation)
  - Can technically achieve without reducing own emissions

- **Carbon Free**: 
  - Goal is to switch entirely to renewable energy sources
  - No direct carbon emissions from power generation
  - More aggressive than carbon neutral

- **Carbon Negative**: 
  - Removes more carbon from atmosphere than the organization emits
  - Invests in projects that offset and remove emissions
  - Example: Microsoft aims to remove all CO₂ company has ever generated by 2050

- **Net Zero Carbon / Net Zero Emissions**: 
  - Balance between emissions produced and emissions removed
  - Can refer to organization or entire value chain

- **Corporate Examples**:
  - Apple: Carbon neutral by 2030
  - Amazon: Net zero carbon by 2040
  - Microsoft: Carbon negative by 2030
  - Google: Carbon neutral since 2007, carbon-free by 2030
  - Facebook: Net zero emissions across value chain by 2030

<expand title="Emissions Scopes">
## Emissions Scopes

- **GHG Protocol**: Standardized framework developed ~20 years ago for measuring and managing emissions
  - Common method for companies and countries to calculate emissions
  - Three scopes of emissions

- **Scope 1 Emissions**: Direct emissions you generate
  - Personal examples: Gas boiler, diesel vehicle, propane barbecue
  - Business examples: Company vehicles, on-site fuel combustion
  - Relatively simple to calculate

- **Scope 2 Emissions**: Indirect emissions from electricity/energy you use
  - Example: Electric car doesn't emit CO₂, but charging from coal power station does
  - Can estimate based on energy consumption
  - More complex than Scope 1, but achievable

- **Scope 3 Emissions**: All other indirect emissions from activities performed on your behalf
  - Products you buy and their manufacturing
  - Packaging and shipping
  - Business travel
  - Raw materials from vendors
  - Supply chain emissions
  - **Extremely difficult to calculate** - shouldn't be underestimated
  - Many organizations focus on Scope 1 and 2 first

- **Carbon Footprint**: Total estimate of emissions across all scopes
  - Useful for individuals and organizations
  - Helps identify areas for improvement
  - Online calculators available for personal use

<expand title="Improving Emissions">
## Improving Emissions

- **Three Main Approaches**:
  1. **Reduce Energy Use**: Use less energy overall
  2. **Change Energy Source**: Move from fossil fuels to renewable sources (solar, wind)
  3. **Offset Emissions**: Balance CO₂ production with activities that remove it (planting trees, funding renewable projects)

- **Carbon Offsets**: 
  - Activities that mitigate or remove CO₂ from atmosphere
  - Often fund renewable energy or reforestation projects
  - Available for individuals and businesses
  - Companies like Wren, TerraPass, Carbonfund.org offer offset services

- **Corporate Sustainability Initiatives**:
  - Reducing business travel
  - Reducing waste
  - Shifting to renewable power sources
  - Product manufacturing lifecycle considerations (especially for hardware companies)

<expand title="Important Dates and Numbers">
## Important Dates and Numbers

- **Key Dates**: 2030, 2050, 2100
