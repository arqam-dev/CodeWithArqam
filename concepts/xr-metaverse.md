- **Focus**: Understanding what it is, how it works, practical use cases, future expectations

</expand>

<expand title="Virtual Reality (VR)">
## Virtual Reality (VR)

- **What It Is**: 
  - Headset that blocks out outside world (opaque)
  - Two lenses showing computer-generated images
  - Completely immersive 3D environment
  - Reacts to your movements

- **Two Types of Headsets**:

  1. **Self-Contained (Untethered)**:
     - Computer and software built into headset
     - Simpler, easier setup, more portable, cheaper
     - Example: Oculus Quest 2
     - Less processing power than PC-connected
  
  2. **Tethered**:
     - Display unit connected to separate PC
     - Requires physical cable connection
     - Better experience: higher definition, better resolution, more realistic
     - Less portable, more complicated setup, more expensive

- **Key Features**:
  - **Sensors**: Track head orientation (up/down, side/side, turning around)
  - **3D View**: Different images to each eye for depth perception
  - **Perspective**: Things appear close or far, sense of scale
  - **Immersion/Presence**: Virtual space feels real enough
  - **Multi-Sensory**: Visual, audio, touch, movement

- **Not Just a Screen**: 
  - Not flat 2D display like TV
  - Immersed in and surrounded by 3D environment
  - Environment reacts to what you're doing

<expand title="Augmented Reality (AR)">
## Augmented Reality (AR)

- **What It Is**: 
  - Not replacing real world with simulated environment
  - Stay looking at current space (office, living room, street, etc.)
  - Superimpose graphics, text, video, digital elements over real world
  - Adding to or augmenting current reality

- **Devices**:
  - **Mobile Devices**: Phones and tablets with cameras
    - Live video feed of real world
    - Overlay computer-generated images
    - Digital elements appear part of real-world space
    - Reposition correctly as you move around
  
  - **Head-Worn Devices**: 
    - Microsoft HoloLens
    - Magic Leap
    - Google Glass
    - Can see through them to see the world

- **Examples**:
  - **Retail**: See products in your home (IKEA, Apple)
  - **Outdoor**: Flight details of planes, stars and planets at night
  - **Tools**: AR tape measure with measurement overlay
  - **Entertainment**: Camera filters (Snapchat, Instagram) - face detection, transformations
  - **Space Mapping**: Fill space with AR effects

- **Casual Use**: 
  - Unlike VR, doesn't require dedicated hardware investment
  - Quick, casual use on devices people already have
  - Many people becoming familiar without realizing it
  - "Bubbling up from the bottom"

- **Business Use**: 
  - Not just casual - very advanced applications
  - Business-focused head-worn devices
  - Serious enterprise applications

<expand title="Mixed Reality (MR)">
## Mixed Reality (MR)

- **What It Is**: 
  - In-between, hybrid stage between AR and VR
  - Spectrum or continuum of extended reality experiences
  - Integration between physical and digital worlds

- **AR Becoming More Like VR**:
  - **Simple AR**: Heads-up display with floating data
  - **Advanced AR**: Digital objects aware of environment, correctly positioned
  - **Interactive AR**: Can press digital buttons, grab and manipulate objects
  - **More Virtual Elements**: More digital objects, avatars, interactions
  - **Result**: Moving toward VR experience

- **VR Incorporating Real World**:
  - Begin in completely simulated VR environment
  - Bring real-world objects into virtual world
  - Example: VR productivity apps can detect your desk and keyboard
  - Generate digital versions of real objects inside virtual environment
  - See your hands on keyboard, can type, take notes

- **Passthrough**:
  - Sensors in VR headsets are tiny cameras
  - Can pass camera image through to screens inside headset
  - Even though headset is opaque, can effectively see through it
  - Often black and white, low-resolution, but helpful for orientation

- **Terminology**: 
  - Some companies use "mixed reality" term (Microsoft)
  - Others call it all "augmented reality" (Apple)
  - Idea is more important than the name

<expand title="The Metaverse">
## The Metaverse

- **What It Is**: 
  - Vision for future state of technology
  - Doesn't fully exist yet (parts do)
  - Combination of many existing technologies

- **Technologies Involved**:
  - Virtual and augmented reality
  - Cloud computing
  - Artificial intelligence
  - Video conferencing
  - Massively multiplayer environments
  - Social networks
  - High-speed mobile internet

- **The Vision**:
  - Persistent, massive, shared 3D world
  - Join in VR and AR
  - Play games, work, meet colleagues, socialize, watch shows, shop, create art, exercise, relax
  - All in one connected experience

- **Current State**:
  - Can do these things in VR, but very separate and disconnected
  - No way to share or cross over between experiences
  - Can't take avatar from one app to another
  - Have to create new avatar for each app

- **Examples of Development**:
  - **AltspaceVR** (Microsoft): Shared social spaces, virtual meeting places
  - **Horizon Worlds** (Meta): Virtual social environments
  - Working on shared spaces, but still separate

- **Questions to Answer**:
  - Who owns what?
  - Who controls access?
  - Who sets standards?
  - How will privacy work?
  - How will commerce work?
  - Do you own what you create?
  - How to buy and sell?
  - Can use cryptocurrency?

- **What's Needed**:
  - More people, greater adoption
  - Better devices: smaller, less intrusive, better battery, better graphics
  - These are coming anyway

- **Better as Answer Than Question**:
  - Can talk about technologies we have now
  - When all these blend together, what do we call it?
  - Answer: Right now, we're calling it the metaverse
  - Word may become redundant (like "information superhighway")
  - But the concept is fundamental part of future

<expand title="VR Technical Requirements">
## VR Technical Requirements

- **Frame Rate**:
  - Computer generates new images for each eye continuously
  - Measured in frames per second (FPS)
  - **TV/Movies**: 24-30 FPS (smooth enough)
  - **High-Def TV**: Up to 60 FPS
  - **VR Minimum**: 60 FPS (bare minimum)
  - **VR Preferred**: 90+ FPS, ideally 120+
  - **Why Critical**: Image beamed directly into eyes, much more sensitive
  - Slow frame rate: disoriented, nauseous

- **Latency**:
  - Minimize delay between head movement and image update
  - If turn head but image doesn't update quickly → motion sickness
  - Mismatch between inner ears and eyes causes problems
  - **More Important Than Resolution**: Fast frame rate and low latency critical

- **Resolution Trade-off**:
  - High-end video/gaming: All about resolution, more pixels
  - **VR Priority**: Speed and smoothness over photorealism
  - Simple environment with high frame rate > photorealistic with slow frame rate
  - That's why VR footage can look "basic" - resolution lowered for performance

- **Hand Controllers**:
  - Come with most VR headsets
  - Multiple buttons and joysticks
  - Unusual shapes help with tracking (position and orientation)
  - See hands in VR for various actions
  - **Haptic Feedback**: Vibration, buzz, tap sensations
    - Helps with sense of presence
    - Feels more immersive when touching virtual objects

- **Hand Tracking**:
  - Some devices allow using hands without controllers
  - Specific gestures to open menus, launch applications
  - Less equipment, easier for new users
  - **Limitation**: Controllers more accurate for fine control and exact operations

</expand>

<expand title="Spatial Awareness and Scanning">
## Spatial Awareness and Scanning

- **Why Needed**:
  - Recognize where you are in room
  - Identify objects (furniture, walls)
  - Position virtual objects correctly
  - Stop you from walking into things

- **LiDAR Scanning**:
  - Light Detection and Ranging
  - Quickly measure distance to nearby objects
  - Available in recent iPhones and iPads
  - Scan entire room and create mesh (like fishing net)
  - Computer representation of the space
  - Continually updates as you move around
  - **Spatial Understanding**: Device knows the space

- **Occlusion**:
  - Virtual objects disappear when they go behind real-world objects
  - Very tricky computationally
  - Necessary for realistic feel
  - Example: Digital object on desk disappears behind real monitor

- **Boundary Definition**:
  - Before using VR, define boundaries of available space
  - Use controller to mark edges of room
  - **Guardian/Chaperone**: Virtual barrier appears when approaching edge
  - Grid appears in view to warn you
  - Prevents walking into walls, falling down stairs, bumping into furniture

</expand>

<expand title="VR Movement Modes">
## VR Movement Modes

- **Stationary VR**:
  - Stay in one place (standing or sitting)
  - Can turn completely around
  - Can lean forward and back
  - Not taking steps in any direction
  - Examples: Flight simulation cockpit, conference table, learning piano

- **Room-Scale VR**:
  - Walk around in physical room
  - Movement mirrored in virtual space
  - Examples: Step around VR sculpture, play virtual tennis, walk around kitchen simulation
  - **Requirements**:
    - Empty area: at least 2m x 2m (6ft x 6ft), preferably more
    - Buffer space on all sides
    - **Challenge**: Most people don't have spare empty room

- **Base Stations**:
  - Some headsets come with base stations
  - Mount in room
  - Improve accuracy of positional tracking
  - Better job of figuring out exactly where you are
  - Makes room-scale more realistic

- **Movement Beyond Room Size**:
  - For exploring larger spaces (buildings, mountains)
  - **Problem**: Moving with joystick causes motion sickness
  - **Solution**: Teleportation
    - Point controller at new location
    - Instantly transported there
    - Less visual stimulus, reduces motion sickness
  - **Alternative**: Dim edges of screen during movement

<expand title="Headset Specifications">
## Headset Specifications

- **Field of View (FOV)**:
  - Amount you can see when wearing headset
  - Reduces peripheral vision (horizontal and vertical)
  - **Oculus Quest 2**: ~90° horizontal (lower end)
  - **HTC VIVE Pro 2**: 120° (costs significantly more)
  - To expand FOV while maintaining quality: larger, higher resolution screens = expensive

- **Foveated Rendering**:
  - Not in most consumer headsets yet, but coming
  - Field of view isn't all same quality
  - Center of vision: high detail (readable text)
  - Peripheral vision: lower detail (can see but can't read)
  - **How It Works**: 
    - Track eye position inside headset
    - Use more computing resources for what you're directly looking at
    - Less resources for peripheral vision
    - Better results with same hardware

- **Fresnel Lenses**:
  - Concentric circles or grooves etched into lens
  - Like lighthouse lenses
  - **Benefits**: Smaller, lighter, can be closer to screen
  - **Downside**: "God rays" - glare and blur with high contrast
    - Like Vaseline smeared on lens
    - Happens in dark rooms with single light source
    - Developers avoid situations that cause this

- **Screen Door Effect**:
  - Early VR issue: could see individual pixels
  - Like pressing face close to old monitor
  - Less issue now: better hardware, higher resolution
  - Developers avoid graphics that cause this
